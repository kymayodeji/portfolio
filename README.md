# Data  Portfolio
# - by Kymberly Ayodeji

I am slowly but surely moving on my various Machine Learning, Data Science, Data Cleaning, Analysis, Engineering and Science projects to one central location. Enjoy.

## Tech Stack
I usually program in Python and SQL for my projects using Jupyter Notebooks. Maybe if I have time, I will convert a few projects into R and Java. My cloud platform of choice varies as I have experience with AWS, GCP and Azure.
